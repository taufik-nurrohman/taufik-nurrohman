### November 2020

This is a good time for me to embrace Node.js. I don’t think of this as a delay. The concept of ECMAScript modules in Node.js has just become familiar [recently](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), as well as the `.mjs` extension which has been introduced everywhere. Makes it easy for me to distinguish and give messages to the browser about which are module codes and which are native codes. If you want some compact and simple node modules, you can try some of my modules:
